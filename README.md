Document Management System for law firms

Hello, I have used ReactJs for the frontend and Firebase as the backend for this document management system. This system enables the user to create folders, upload files and search files. The user can also view the uploaded files in the new window or if the file is too large, you can download it directly too! 

<h2> Installation guide </h2>

2. Open a terminal under this repo.
3. Run 'npm -i' command to install the node modules
4. Run 'ng serve'
5. Enter the command 'npm start' and hit enter.
6. The application will run on localhost:3000 on your machine!
